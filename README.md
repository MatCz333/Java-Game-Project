# Java-Game-Project
A simple game made in Java which is similar to Minecraft where you steer a Builder across the map to dig tiles. 

To play the game open the files in any IDE and start the src/MainApplication.java main method. 
When the GUI loads you will have to upload to map on to play. The one provided is in the maps/ folder.

Have fun!
